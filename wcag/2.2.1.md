## Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable

(Level A)

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable#intent), replacing “the content” with “views”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.2.1 Timing Adjustable:** For each time limit that is set by **[views](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-views)**, at least one of the following is true:

- Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
- Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
- Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, “press the space bar”), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
- Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
- Essential Exception: The time limit is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
- 20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

> ### NOTE 1
> This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.
