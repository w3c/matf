This is a W3C Group Note on "Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile Applications (WCAG2Mobile)". The purpose of this work is to build upon "Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile" [mobile-accessibility-mapping], but also to have a stronger focus on mobile applications and include changes made in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.

To comment, [file an issue in the W3C MATF GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/matf/issues/new).
