To comment, [file an issue in the W3C matf GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/matf/issues/new). The Task Force requests that public comments be filed as new issues, one issue per discrete comment. It is free to create a GitHub account to file issues. If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, send email to [public-agwg-comments@w3.org](mailto:public-agwg-comments@w3.org?subject=WCAG%203.0%20public%20comment) ([comment archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-agwg-comments/)). In-progress updates to the guidelines can be viewed in the [public editors’ draft](https://w3c.github.io/wcag3/guidelines/).
