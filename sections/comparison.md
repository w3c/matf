### Comparison with the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Working Draft Note

In this Draft Note, most of the existing sections have undergone significant review and updates. The current Draft has been restructured to align with WCAG2ICT rather than continue with the structure and format of the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Mapping document.

With this perspective in mind, the following list highlights where this current document differs from the 2015 Mobile Accessibility Mapping document to apply all success criteria of WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, WCAG 2.2, and acknowledge the change to 4.1.1 Parsing to mobile applications:

- New Background section to explain the changes in scope for the current document
- Modifications to key terms introduced by WCAG2ICT:
  - closed functionality
  - menu-driven interface
  - platform software
  - virtual keyboard
- New key terms introduced by WCAG2Mobile:
  - [note:Work In Progress. See [Key Terms](#key-terms) section.]
- Inclusion of all WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria and not just those specifically affected by mobile phone usage.

The prior 2015 Mobile Working Draft Note included specific guidance on the following WCAG 2.0 success criteria for mobile, primarily for a mobile web context:

- Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (Level AAA)
- Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) (Level A)
- Success Criterion 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.2.4 Consistent Identification (Level AA)
- Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
- Success Criterion 3.3.5 Help (Level AAA)

Supporting documentation in the Mobile Mapping Appendix included [WCAG 2.0 Techniques that Apply to Mobile](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/MobileTechniques/) to address mobile web use cases for the rest of the WCAG 2.0 success criteria at Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA, as they were available in 2015 when the webpage was published. However, most listed techniques have limited application to native mobile applications and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter and React Native.

This document includes all the relevant WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria and guidelines:

- Success Criterion 1.3.4 Orientation
- Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose
- Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow
- Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast
- Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing
- Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus
- Success Criterion 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts
- Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures
- Success Criterion 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation
- Success Criterion 2.5.3 Label in Name
- Success Criterion 2.5.4 Motion Actuation
- Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages
  
This document includes all the relevant WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria:

- Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)
- Success Criterion 2.5.7 Dragging Movements
- Success Criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)
- Success Criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help
- Success Criterion 3.3.7 Redundant Entry
