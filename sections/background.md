### Background

This document is an iteration on Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile [[mobile-accessibility-mapping]], published in February 2015. The document was intended to become a [Group Note](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-5-2-group-note) but it did not move to the next maturity stage. The most recent publication was an [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/) in December 2018.

After 2018, the Mobile Accessibility Task Force (MATF) ensured that mobile considerations were included in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2, such as:

- 1.3.4 Orientation (AA), to support multiple display orientations;
- 1.4.10 Reflow (AA), to improve presentation on small screens;
- 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A), to provide single-pointer alternatives for touch gestures;
- 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A), to provide alternatives for device motion;
- 2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA), to provide single-pointer alternatives for dragging;
- 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA), to providing minimum touch target sizes;
- 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A), to reduce the amount of repetitive typing.

In January 2024, MATF regrouped and welcomed new participants to work on updated guidance for applying WCAG 2.2 to mobile applications.

This current document, “Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile Applications (WCAG2Mobile)” maps directly to the W3C supporting document, Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT) [[wcag2ict-22]], which was published as a Group Note in October 2024, describing how WCAG 2.2 could be applied to non-web documents and software.

The intention of MATF is to publish WCAG2Mobile as a [Group Note](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-5-2-group-note), just like WCAG2ICT.

WCAG2ICT is organized to mirror the principle, guideline and success criterion structure of WCAG; this model is also used in WCAG2Mobile. WCAG2ICT clarifies when and how WCAG Level A and Level AA success criteria could be applied to non-web documents and software; WCAG2Mobile narrows the scope of this work to mobile applications.
