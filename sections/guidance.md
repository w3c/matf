### Guidance in this Document

This document provides informative guidance (guidance that is not [normative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-normative) and that does not set requirements) with regard to the interpretation and application of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to Mobile Applications. This document is a [Group Note](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-5-2-group-note) (in contrast to WCAG 2.2, which is a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#REC)). Specifically, this document provides informative guidance on applying WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria to Mobile Applications, including but not limited to native mobile apps, mobile web apps and hybrid apps using web components inside native mobile apps.

#### Interpretation of Web Terminology in a Mobile Context

When certain Web-specific terms or phrases like “web page(s)” were used in success criteria, those were replaced with mobile terms or phrases like “screen(s)” or “view(s)”. Additional notes were also provided to explain the terminology replacements.

A small number of success criteria are written to apply to “a set of web pages” or “multiple web pages” and depend upon all pages in the set to share some characteristic or behavior. Since the unit of conformance in WCAG 2 is a single web page, the task force agreed that the equivalent unit of conformance for mobile applications is a single screen within the application. It follows that an equivalent unit of evaluation for a “set of web pages” would be a “set of screens”, not, as previously interpreted in WCAG2ICT, as a “set of software”. These terms are defined in the Key Terms section of this document. See “set of screens” to determine when a group of screens in a mobile application are considered a set.

The glossary terms were also reviewed and most of them applied to mobile applications, as written. Some applied with additional notes or edits (largely related to phrases like “Web page(s)”), and a small number of terms were only used in Level AAA success criteria which are not addressed by the WCAG2Mobile Note at this time.
