## Key Terms

WCAG2Mobile defines key glossary terms to refine the broader scope of WCAG2ICT for mobile applications. It introduces terms that do not exist in WCAG2ICT or WCAG but are important to define for a mobile application context.

“Content” and “user agent” are glossary terms from WCAG2ICT that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to mobile applications.

The glossary terms “document” and “software” in WCAG2ICT are replaced with the defined terms “screen” and “view”. The glossary terms “set of web pages”, “set of documents” and “set of software programs” are replaced with the defined term “set of screens”.

The term “accessibility services of platform software”, introduced by WCAG2ICT, has been modified to reflect its different use in mobile applications. Additionally, “closed functionality” has a different meaning in the context of mobile applications.

The remaining glossary terms from WCAG2ICT and WCAG 2 are addressed in [WCAG2ICT: Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#comments-on-definitions-in-wcag-2-glossary).

Terms defined and used in WCAG2Mobile are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2Mobile. Further information on usage of these terms follows.
