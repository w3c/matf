## Key Terms

WCAG2Mobile defines key glossary terms to refine the broader scope of WCAG2ICT for mobile applications. It introduces terms that do not exist in WCAG2ICT or WCAG but are important to define for a mobile application context.

“Content” and “user agent” are glossary terms from WCAG2ICT that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to mobile applications.

The glossary terms “document” and “software” in WCAG2ICT are replaced with the defined terms “screen” and “view”. The glossary terms “set of web pages”, “set of documents” and “set of software programs” are replaced with the defined term “set of screens”.

The term “accessibility services of platform software”, introduced by WCAG2ICT, has been modified to reflect its different use in mobile applications. Additionally, “closed functionality” has a different meaning in the context of mobile applications.

The remaining glossary terms from WCAG2ICT and WCAG 2 are addressed in [WCAG2ICT: Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#comments-on-definitions-in-wcag-2-glossary).

Terms defined and used in WCAG2Mobile are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2Mobile. Further information on usage of these terms follows.

[note:**Work in Progress**. See [Issues labeled as 'definition' on GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/matf/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adefinition).]

### Content

The term **content**, as used in WCAG2Mobile, has the meaning below:

<dl>
<dt>content</dt>
<dd>
(work in progress)
</div>
</dd>
</dl>

### Page

The term **page**, as used in WCAG2Mobile, has the meaning below:

<dl>
<dt>page</dt>
<dd>
A page is a distinct part of a mobile application that presents specific content or functionality and is rendered together with its associated resources. Users navigate between pages to complete actions or access different features.
</dd>
</dl>

[note:Interface elements that rely on the underlying page for context (such as dialogs, modals, navigation menus, and similar components) are typically considered part of that page rather than standalone pages. However, interface elements that significantly change the majority of screen content or function as independent navigational destinations may be considered separate pages.]

[example1:A native banking app's account overview screen that displays account balances, recent transactions and interactive charts. The screen includes native components for all interface elements, all rendered together as a single interface.]

[example2:A mobile web banking app's account overview page that displays account balances, recent transactions and interactive charts. The page includes web components for all interface elements, all rendered together in the mobile browser.]

[example3:A hybrid banking app's account overview screen that displays account balances, recent transactions and interactive charts. The screen includes native components for account balances and recent transactions, plus web components for interactive charts, all rendered together as a unified interface.]

### User interface component

The term **user interface component**, as used in WCAG2Mobile, has the meaning below:

<dl>
<dt>user interface component</dt>
<dd>
a part of the <a href="#content">content</a> that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function 
</dd>
</dl>

[note:Multiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.]

[note:User interface components include form elements, buttons, and links as well as components generated by code.]

[note:What is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".]

[example1: A carousel is a container that could have three distinct user interface controls. A "pause" button to prevent automatic scrolling, and a "next" and "previous" button for manual navigation. Each of these three are be considered separate and unique elements.]
