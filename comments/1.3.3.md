This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sensory-characteristics#intent), with the addition of “haptics” to the list of sensory characteristics.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics:** Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, sound, or **haptics**.
