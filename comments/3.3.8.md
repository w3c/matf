## Success Criterion 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)

(Level AA)

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum), replacing “Web site” with “application”.

A [cognitive function test](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-cognitive-function-test) (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes) unless that step provides at least one of the following:

**Alternative**
Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.

**Mechanism**
A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.

**Object Recognition**
The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.

**Personal Content**
The cognitive function test is to identify [non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content) the user provided to the **application**.

[note:“Object recognition” and “Personal content” may be represented by images, video, or audio.]

[note:Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include: support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.]

[note:Any passwords used to unlock underlying [platform software](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#platform-software) (running below the non-web software) are out of scope for this requirement since these are not under control of the non-web software’s author.]

[note:There are cases where non-web software has an authentication process and no alternative or assistance mechanism is feasible, for example when entering a password when starting, powering on / turning on an ICT (device or otherwise). In such situations, it may not be possible for the non-web software to satisfy this success criterion.]
