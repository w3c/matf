## Success Criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help

(Level A)

[wcag:consistent-help]
[wcag2ict:applying-sc-3-2-6-consistent-help-to-non-web-documents-and-software]

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help), replacing "web page(s)" with "page(s)" and "CSS break-point" with "break-point".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**3.2.6 Consistent Help:** If a **[page](#page)** contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those mechanisms are repeated on multiple **[pages](#page)** within a set of **[pages](#page)**, they occur in the same order relative to other **[page](#page)** content, unless a change is initiated by the user:

- Human contact details;
- Human contact mechanism;
- Self-help option;
- A fully automated contact mechanism.

[note:Help mechanisms may be provided directly on the [page](#page), or may be provided via a direct link to a different [page](#page) containing the information.]

[note:For this success criterion, "the same order relative to other [page](#page) content" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the [page](#page) is serialized. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across [pages](#page) for the same*[page](#page) variation (e.g., **break-point**). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the [page](#page)'s zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different [page](#page) variation. This criterion is concerned with relative order across [pages](#page) displayed in the same [page](#page) variation (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).]
