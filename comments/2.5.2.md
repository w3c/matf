This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-cancellation#intent).

**2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation:** For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:

<dl>
<dt>No Down-Event</dt>
<dd>
The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function;
</dd>
<dt>Abort or Undo</dt>
<dd>
Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion;
</dd>
<dt>Up Reversal</dt>
<dd>
The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event;
</dd>
<dt>Essential</dt>
<dd>
Completing the function on the down-event is essential.
</dd>
</dl>

[note:This requirement applies to mobile applications that interpret pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the platform software, operating system, or assistive technology). Each layer is responsible for its own pointer actions only, not for those in an underlying layer.]

[note:Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.]

[note:The determination of "essential" should focus on whether the function itself requires down-event activation, rather than solely on technological constraints. However, limitations of the underlying technology platform may also constitute valid exceptions where developers cannot provide alternative implementations.]

<div class="example">
<strong>Example:</strong>
<br/>
Examples of essential functionality for mobile applications include:
<ul>
  <li>Drawing and sketching applications where continuous pressure-sensitive input begins on the down-event.</li>
  <li>Keyboard emulation apps where keys activate on down-event to match expected physical keyboard behavior.</li>
  <li>Musical instrument applications where the down-event timing is essential to produce the intended sound at the correct moment.</li>
  <li>Gaming applications requiring precise down-event timing such as rhythm games, sports simulations and action games.
  </li>
</ul>
