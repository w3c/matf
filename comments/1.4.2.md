## Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control

(Level A)

[wcag:audio-control]
[wcag2ict:applying-sc-1-4-2-audio-control-to-non-web-documents-and-software]

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control#intent), replacing “Web page” with “page” and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.4.2 Audio Control:** If any audio on a **[page](#page)** plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

[note:Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole **[page](#page)**, all content on the **[page](#page)** (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.]
