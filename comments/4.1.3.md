This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages), removing “implemented using markup languages”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**4.1.3 Status Messages:** In content, [status messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages#dfn-status-message) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages#dfn-programmatically-determined) through [role](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages#dfn-role) or properties such that they can be presented to the user by [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages#dfn-assistive-technology) without receiving focus.

[note:This is typically enabled through the use of accessibility services of the [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#user-agent) or [platform software](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#platform-software).]
