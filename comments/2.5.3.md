This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/label-in-name#intent).

**2.5.3 Label in Name:** For [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) with [labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-labels) that include [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text) or [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-images-of-text), the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name) contains the text that is presented visually.

[note:A best practice is to have the text of the label at the start of the name. This ensures voice users can activate controls with voice commands.]

[note:Some controls such as tiles, cards, or list items may include multiple text components. While all visible text should be available to assistive technologies, only text that serves as the primary label needs to be included in the accessible name.]

[note:Custom accessibility actions that group multiple functions may use descriptive names like "actions available" for assistive technologies.]
