This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from [Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/label-in-name#intent).

**2.5.3 Label in Name:** For [user interface components](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-interface-components) with [labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-labels) that include [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text) or [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-images-of-text), the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-name) contains the text that is presented visually.

[note:A best practice is to have the text of the label at the start of the name. This is particularly important for voice control users who rely on speaking the visible text to interact with user interface components.]

[note:Some user interface components such as tiles, cards, or list items may include multiple text components. The text that serves as the primary label must be contained in the name. Other visible text components may be exposed through other accessibility properties.]

[note:Custom accessibility actions that group multiple functions may use descriptive names like "actions available" for assistive technologies.]
