This applies directly as written, and as described in Intent from [Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data) replacing “web pages” with “pages”.

With this substitution, it would read:

3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data): For **[pages](#page)** that cause [legal commitments](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-legal-commitments) or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete [user-controllable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-controllable) data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:

1. Reversible: Submissions are reversible.
2. Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for [input errors](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-input-error) and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
3. Confirmed: A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.
